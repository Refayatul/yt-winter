# Requirements checklist — growth platform iteration (started 2026-10-03)

Source: the "production-grade, multi-channel, analytics-driven, self-improving
YouTube growth platform" specification (phases 0–27). Every requirement has an
ID and a status: TODO · IN PROGRESS · DONE · BLOCKED. DONE items record files,
tests and evidence. Re-read before every phase; update after every phase.

Runtime: Node.js 20 (CommonJS) + Python unittest; state is JSON files under
`channels/<slug>/{state,memory,analytics}` (legacy Failure Reconstructed paths
under `icerik/`, `analytics/`); GitHub Actions is the scheduler/runtime.

## Gap matrix (Phase 0 audit)

| Requirement | Current implementation | Quality | Gap | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shared platform, isolated channel state | `core/channel-context.js`, `core/growth/store.js` (all paths derived from one slug), per-channel configs | Good | — | KEEP |
| Canonical UC… channel ID per channel | `<PREFIX>_YT_CHANNEL_ID` variables; `lib/yt.verifyChannelIdentity` before writes | Good | publish job's own channel not compared with the credential | EXTEND |
| OAuth isolation / health | `lib/yt.js`, `oauth-health.js`, `youtube-oauth-health.yml` (PR #90) | Good | — | KEEP |
| Idempotent upload | title-only duplicate check in `youtube-yukle.js`; fail-open when the check errors; new session on every retry; `upload-state.json` unused | **Weak** | key, intent journal, resumable-session reconciliation, publishAt match, fail-closed | ADD |
| Retry classification | 3 tries, fixed 10/20 s waits, only `>=500` retried | Weak | 429/quota/auth/validation classes, exp backoff + jitter | ADD |
| Dry-run / shadow / staging | `--dogrula`, `PUBLISH=0`, `dry_run`, `YT_PRIVACY` | Partial | explicit shadow mode, pre-flight report | EXTEND |
| Analytics per video | `lib/analitik.js`, `core/growth/analytics.js` checkpoints 1h…28d with `collectedAt` | Good | — | KEEP |
| channel_daily / video_daily / traffic_daily | none | Missing | incremental warehouse + 12-month backfill | ADD |
| Derived metrics | `core/growth/performance.derive` (velocity, conversion, rates) | Good | net subscribers, watch-minutes/view, engagement/1k | EXTEND |
| Shorts vs long baselines | `performance`, `diagnosis` split by contentType | Good | — | KEEP |
| Diagnosis | `core/growth/diagnosis.js` (+ plateau/breakout in performance) | Good | spec codes (STRONG_TOPIC_AUDIENCE_FIT, SEARCH_DEPENDENT, STRONG_DISCOVERY, CADENCE_QUALITY_RISK, aliases) | EXTEND |
| Topic intelligence | topic-model/topic-scoring, explore buckets, popularity (PR #94) | Good | predicted-vs-actual topic/cluster ledger, fatigue signal | EXTEND |
| Hooks / titles | `hooks.js`, `titles.js` candidates + scores in growth-plan.json; pattern freshness (PR #95) | Good | prediction-vs-outcome ledger | EXTEND |
| Thumbnails | `thumbnail-strategy.js`, long-form concepts | Partial | versioned asset metadata ledger | EXTEND |
| Experiments | `core/growth/experiments.js` single-variable, idempotent | Good | — | KEEP |
| Learning loop | `core/growth/learning.js` (observation→hypothesis→adopted), weekly summary | Good | predictions ledger feeding inspection | EXTEND |
| Series | `core/series.js`, funnel/relationships | Good | — | KEEP |
| Quota | ad-hoc QUOTA_ERROR classification only | Missing | central cost policy + per-channel ledger | ADD |
| Observability | `GrowthRuntime.alert`, issues, health | Partial | structured per-channel ops event log + metrics summary | ADD |
| Provenance | `visual-attribution.json`, FR source ledger, description credits | Partial | unified per-video provenance manifest | EXTEND |
| Reporting | growth dashboard, daily ops report, weekly learning | Good | analytics freshness / ops / quota sections | EXTEND |
| TikTok | retired by owner on 2026-10-02 (PR #93); code dormant | — | spec says "preserve TikTok" — conflicts with the owner's decision | BLOCKED (owner decision) |

## Checklist

### Architecture / audit
- ARCH-01 Phase 0 audit + gap matrix — **DONE** (this file).
- ARCH-02 Single shared platform, channel-isolated state — **DONE** (existing; `tests/js/multi-channel.test.js`, `tests/js/growth.test.js` isolation tests).

### Identity / security
- ID-01 Canonical UC… ID per channel — **DONE** (existing `<PREFIX>_YT_CHANNEL_ID`; `oauth-health` verifies all three).
- ID-02 publish_job.channel == credential channel == authenticated channel, fail closed — **DONE**. `Safety.jobChannelCheck` (job tag + expected UC ID) before auth; `getYouTubeClient` verifies the authenticated channel. Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- SEC-01 Channel-specific credentials, no mixing — **DONE** (PR #90; `tests/js/oauth.test.js` partial-migration test).
- SEC-02 No secrets in logs/reports — **DONE**. Ops log drops credential-like keys and masks token-like values; upload logs print classified codes only. Test: quota-ops.test.js (OBS-01 / SEC-02).
- SEC-03 No secrets committed (history scan) — **DONE** (268 commits scanned 2026-10-02, none found).

### Publishing
- PUBLISH-01 Idempotency key SHA256(channel_id, media_hash, normalized_title, publish_at) — **DONE**. `idempotencyKey()` uses the authenticated UC ID. Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-02 Intent journal written before the upload session — **DONE**. `upload-state.json` intents (IN_FLIGHT/COMPLETED/FAILED); session URLs in git-ignored `.upload-sessions.json` (repo is public). Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-03 Reconcile before upload/retry — **DONE**. Order: completed journal intent → open session status → uploads playlist matched by normalized title OR identical scheduled publishAt. Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-04 Fail closed when reconciliation is impossible — **DONE**. `recentUploads` throws → exit 9, no session opened (old fail-open path removed). Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-05 Retry classes + bounded exp backoff + full jitter — **DONE**. `classifyFailure` (NETWORK/RATE_LIMIT/SERVER retried; QUOTA/AUTH/VALIDATION/PERMANENT not), `backoffDelay`. Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-06 Resume an interrupted session — **DONE**. `runUpload` queries the session after every retryable failure: COMPLETE → that video, INCOMPLETE → resume from the received byte, never a second session unless YouTube says EXPIRED. Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-07 Publish modes — **DONE**. `PUBLISH_MODE=live|shadow|dry-run` (`--dogrula` = dry-run); private/unlisted via existing `YT_PRIVACY`/flags. Default unchanged (live). Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
- PUBLISH-08 Pre-flight — **DONE**. `PUBLISH-PREFLIGHT.json`: channel + authenticated ID, media SHA-256 + bytes, title, schedule, privacy, quality gate, idempotency key, duplicate state, quota. Existing metadata validation + quality gate kept. Files: lib/publish-safety.js, youtube-yukle.js, core/channel-context.js (allChannels), .gitignore. Tests: tests/js/publish-safety.test.js (14 pass), npm test 225 pass.
