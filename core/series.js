// SERIES IDENTITY — every Short is a numbered episode of its channel's series
// ("FAILURE FILE #13"). A recurring, numbered format tells a viewer there is
// more coming, which is what a subscription is for; one-off videos give no
// reason to subscribe.
//
// The episode number is the channel's count of published Shorts before this
// one, plus one. A topic that is re-rendered keeps its number; a render that is
// never uploaded leaves the number for the next Short.
